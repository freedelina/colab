# The Explorer

"There's no sense in going further - it's the edge of cultivation," 
  So they said, and I believed it - broke my land and sowed my crop -
Built my barns and strung my fences in the little border station 
  Tucked away below the foothills where the trails run out and stop:


  So I went, worn out of patience; never told my nearest neighbours -
  Stole away with pack and ponies - left 'em drinking in the town;
And the faith that moveth mountains didn't seem to help my labours
  As I faced the sheer main-ranges, whipping up and leading down.
